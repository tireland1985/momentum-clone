# momentum-clone
My attempt at implementing a momentum clone, using both code from class and the tutorials [here](https://academy.nomadcoders.co/courses/enrolled/434568)<br />
This was originally scheduled to be an in-class project, but I dont know if the relevant session happened..

Requires JavaScript (local storage, geolocation) to work.<br />
To Use, enter name at the top, hit enter.<br />
Submission is controlled by the enter key.

Errors:<br />
For some reason, the JS code from my [todo-list](https://github.com/tireland1985/todo-list) repo does not work as expected here, hence why I used some of the code from the tutorials above. Confusingly, the code in my todo-list repo works as expected in its standalone version. <br />
If you replace the content of todo.js with the code from the above mentioned repository you will see what I mean..
